    <h1> Welcome To Task 3 </h1>
    <h4>
        DESCRIPTION ::) 
                In Javascript, There are 6 datatypes : 
    </h4>
    <p>
        The datatypes are : String, Number, Boolean, Null, undefined, Symbol.
    </p>
    <br><br> <hr><hr> <br><br>
    <h3>The String datatype ::) </h3>
    <p>
        The string date type is used to represent textual data (i.e. sequences of characters). Strings are created using only single or double 
        quotes surrounding one or more characters. 
    </p> <br><br>
    <h3>The Number Datatype ::) </h3>
    <p>
        The number data type is used to represent positive or negative numbers with or without decimal place, or numbers written using exponential notation e.g. 1.5e-4 (is equivalent to 1.5 x 10 <sup> -4 </sup>).
    </p> <br><br>
    <h3> The Boolean Datatype :;) </h3>
    <p>
        The Boolean Datatype can hold any values. true or false. It is typically used to store values like yes(true) or no(false).
    </p> <br><br>
    <h3>The Undefined Datatype ::) </h3>
    <p>
        The Undefined datatype can only have-the special value undefined. If a variable has been declared, but has not been assigned a value, has the value undefined.
    </p> <br><br>
    <h3>The Null Datatype ::) </h3>
    <p>
        This is another special datatype that can have only one value-the null value. A null value means that there is no value. It is not 
        equivalent to an empty string ('') or 0, it is simply something. A variable van be explicitly emptied of its current contents 
        by assingning it the null value. 
    </p> <br><br>
    <h3>The Object Datatype ::) </h3>
    <p>
        The object is a complex datatype that allows you to store collections of data. An object contains properties, defined as a key-value 
        pair. A property key(name) is always a string, but the value can be any datatype, like strings, numbers, booleans, or complex datatypes 
        like arrays, function and other objects.
    </p> <br><br>
    <h3>The Array Datatype ::) </h3>
    <p>
        An array is a type of object used for storing multiple values in single variable. Each value(also called an element) in an array has a 
        numeric position, known as its indec, and it may contain data of any dat type-numbers, strings, booleans, functions, objects, and even other arrays. The array index starts form 0, so that the first array element is arr[0] not arr[1]. The simplest way to create an array is by specifying the array elements as a comma-seperated list enclosed by square brackets.
    </p> <br><br>
    <h3>The Function Datatype ::)</h3>
    <p>
        The function is callabel object that executes a block of code. Since functions are objects, so it is possible to assign them to variabes. 
    </p> <br><br>
    <h3>The typeof Operator</h3>
    <p>
        The typeof opeartor can be used to find out what type of data a variable or opeand contains. It can be used with or without paranthases (typeof(x) or typeof x). The typeof Operator is particularly usefulin the situations when uou need to process the values of different types differently, but you need to be very careful, because it may produce unexpected result in some cases.
